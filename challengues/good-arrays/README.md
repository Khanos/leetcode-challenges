A "good array" (or "good string" in this case, since we're dealing with strings and characters) is a string that has no consecutive duplicate characters.

In other words, in a "good string", every character is different from the character immediately following it. If the original string has any consecutive duplicate characters, they are removed in the "good string".

For example, if the original string is 'aabbcc', the corresponding "good string" would be 'abc', because the duplicate 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's have been removed.
